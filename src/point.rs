        // iterator `it` pointing to the sequence and any non-negative integer
        // `n` such that `it + n` is a valid iterator pointing to an
        // element of the sequence, `comp(*(it + n), *it)` `(or *(it + n) <
        // *it)` evaluates to `false`.

        // Deciphering this arcane bullshit closely (seriously, what was math
        // notation invented for if not to express exactly stuff like this with
        // care?): For any `0 <= k < n < vec.len()`, comp(vec[n], vec[k]) is
        // false. Put differently. (vec[n] < vec[k]) is false. In other words,
        // we are ordering elements in a "non-decreasing" (i.e. increasing or
        // equal) order See now the definition comment below.
